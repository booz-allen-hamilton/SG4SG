There are many different types of crimes but, generally, crimes can be divided into four major categories, personal crimes, property crimes, inchoate crimes, and Statutory Crimes:

<b>Personal Crimes</b> – “Offenses against the Person”: These are crimes that result in physical or mental harm to another person. Personal crimes include:<br>
Assault <br>
Battery<br>
False Imprisonment<br>
Kidnapping<br>
Homicide – crimes such as first and second degree, murder, and involuntary manslaughter, and vehicular homicide<br>
Rape, statutory rape, sexual assault and other offenses of a sexual nature<br>
<b>Property Crimes</b> – “Offenses against Property”: These are crimes that do not necessarily involve harm to another person. Instead, they involve an interference with another person’s right to use or enjoy their property. Property crimes include:<br>
Larceny (theft)<br>
Robbery (theft by force) – Note: this is also considered a personal crime since it results in physical and mental harm.<br>
Burglary (penalties for burglary)<br>
Arson<br>
Embezzlement<br>
Forgery<br>
False pretenses<br>
Receipt of stolen goods.<br>
<b>Inchoate Crimes</b> – “Inchoate” translates into “incomplete”, meaning crimes that were begun, but not completed. This requires that a person take a substantial step to complete a crime, as opposed to just “intend” to commit a crime. Inchoate crimes include:<br>
Attempt – any crime that is attempted like “attempted robbery”<br>
Solicitation<br>
Conspiracy<br>
<b>Statutory Crimes</b> – A violation of a specific state or federal statute and can involve either property offenses or personal offense. Statutory crimes include:<br>
Alcohol-related crimes such as drunk driving (DUI)<br>
Selling alcohol to a minor. <br>

Usually carries a fine and jail sentence of less than a year, if at all.<br>
